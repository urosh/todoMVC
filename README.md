This is TodoMVC backbone application. I want to do few things here. First i am in the process of learning Backbone.js and Javascript in general. So this one of the important reasons for doing this. 
Another reason is to practice and learn git techniques. Also to use git with github, to learn and to practice. 
I hope in some time i will come back to this project and be proud of my first steps. 

Good luck everyone!
